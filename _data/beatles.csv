https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c0/PleasePleaseMe_audio_cover.jpg,Please Tease Me,"March 22, 1963",1,—,"Once ""Please Please Me"" rocketed to number one, the Beatles rushed to deliver a debut album, bashing out Please Please Me in a day. Decades after its release, the album still sounds fresh, precisely because of its intense origins. As the songs rush past, it's easy to get wrapped up in the sound of the record itself without realizing how the album effectively summarizes the band's eclectic influences. Naturally, the influences shine through their covers, all of which are unconventional and illustrate the group's superior taste. There's a love of girl groups, vocal harmonies, sophisticated popcraft, schmaltz, R&B, and hard-driving rock & roll, which is enough to make Please Please Meimpressive, but what makes it astonishing is how these elements converge in the originals. ""I Saw Here Standing There"" is one of their best rockers, yet it has surprising harmonies and melodic progressions. ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place"" grow out of the girl group tradition without being tied to it. A few of their originals, such as ""Do You Want to Know a Secret"" and the pleasantly light ""P.S. I Love You,"" have dated slightly, but endearingly so, since they're infused with cheerful innocence and enthusiasm. And there is an innocence to Please Please Me. the Beatles may have played notoriously rough dives in Hamburg, but the only way you could tell that on their first album was how the constant gigging turned the group into a tight, professional band that could run through their set list at the drop of a hat with boundless energy. It's no surprise that Lennon had shouted himself hoarse by the end of the session, barely getting through ""Twist and Shout,"" the most famous single take in rock history. He simply got caught up in the music, just like generations of listeners did."
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0a/Withthebeatlescover.jpg,With the Beatles,"November 22, 1963",1,—,"With the Beatles is a sequel of the highest order -- one that betters the original by developing its own tone and adding depth. While it may share several similarities with its predecessor -- there is an equal ratio of covers-to-originals, a familiar blend of girl group, Motown, R&B, pop, and rock, and a show tune that interrupts the flow of the album -- With the Beatles is a better record that not only rocks harder, it's considerably more sophisticated. They could deliver rock & roll straight (""I Wanna Be Your Man"") or twist it around with a little Latin lilt (""Little Child,"" one of their most underrated early rockers); Lennonand McCartney wrote sweet ballads (the achingly gorgeous ""All I've Got to Do"") and sprightly pop/rockers (""All My Loving"") with equal aplomb; and the propulsive rockers (""It Won't Be Long"") were as richly melodic as slower songs (""Not a Second Time""). Even George Harrison's first recorded song, ""Don't Bother Me,"" is a standout, with its wonderfully foreboding minor-key melody. Since the Beatlescovered so much ground with their originals, their covers pale slightly in comparison, particularly since they rely on familiar hits (only ""Devil in Her Heart"" qualifies as a forgotten gem). But for every ""Roll Over Beethoven,"" a surprisingly stiff reading of the Chuck Berry standard, there is a sublime moment, such as Lennon's soaring interpretation of ""You Really Got a Hold on Me,"" and the group always turns in thoroughly enjoyable performances. Still, the heart of With the Beatles lies not in the covers, but the originals, where it was clear that, even at this early stage, the Beatles were rapidly maturing and changing, turning into expert craftsmen and musical innovators."

The Beatles,"January 10, 1964",—,2,"The first Beatles album released in the U.S., Introducing...The Beatles is a slightly abridged version ofPlease Please Me, which had been released in the U.K. four months earlier. It includes two fewer tracks than its British counterpart, deleting ""Please Please Me"" and ""Ask Me Why."" Today, of course, there's no reason to prefer it to Please Please Me, which was released in the U.S. in 1987, but from 1963 to 1965, when Capitol Records belatedly released the material on The Early Beatles, this (plus some inferior Vee Jay repackagings) was the only American album containing some of the Beatles' initial recordings."
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/52/Meet_the_Beatles.jpg,Meet the Beatles!,"January 20, 1964",—,1,"Meet the Beatles! wasn't the first Beatles album released in the U.S. (that would've been Introducing the Beatles, on Vee Jay), but as the first Beatles album released by Capitol Records, it was indeed the LP where many millions of Americans were introduced to the Fab Four. As an introduction, there could hardly have been one better. Largely comprised of material released on their second U.K. LP, With the Beatles -- the album art offers a blue-tinted spin on that late-1963 release -- Meet the Beatles!contains nine of that album's 14 songs, cutting out almost all the covers (all the better for publishing rights, but also an effective showcase of the group's talents; it's hard not to view the inclusion of the one remaining cover, ""Till There Was You"" from The Music Man, as a way to illustrate how Meet the Beatles! could appeal to parents) in a quest to trim the LP down to 12 songs. What was added to theWith the Beatles material are three of the Beatles best early songs: their American breakthrough single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" and its U.K. B-side ballad ""This Boy,"" plus ""I Saw Her Standing There"" from their U.K. debut Please Please Me (this song was the B-side of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" in the U.S.). The revisions make Meet the Beatles! slightly more of a frenetic rock & roll record than its parent LP -- there isn't much R&B or as many ballads -- which, at the time, made it an appropriate soundtrack for the wild heyday of Beatlemania but, as the years have passed, the emphasis on joyous, exuberant rock & roll means that Meet the Beatles! still sounds fresh and exciting on its own terms. [A 50th Anniversary release of the album included both mono and stereo mixes of the original.]"

As such, it offends some historical purists, who don't think of it as a real album. Regardless of its origins, however, The Beatles' Second Albumstands as probably best pure rock & roll album ever issued of the group's music. In the process of pulling songs from various British and American EPs, singles (including ""She Loves You"") and B-sides, as well as tracks left over from the editing of With the Beatles for American release, the compilers somehow managed to avoid any trace of the pop ballads favored by Paul McCartney that usually slowed down the group's other early albums, and the result was the longest uninterrupted body of hard rock & roll and R&B in their entire output. No other long-player by the group featured them doing more covers of songs by black American artists or songwriters, including Little Richard(""Long Tall Sally""),Chuck Berry (""Roll Over Beethoven""), Smokey Robinson (""You Really Got a Hold on Me""), Barrett Strong (""Money""), and others, and just to show how rich a vein this all was at the time of its release, the version of ""Roll Over Beethoven"" here actually charted briefly as a single, while ""Long Tall Sally"" served as their concert finale."
http://cps-static.rovicorp.com/3/JPG_400/MI0001/527/MI0001527741.jpg?partner=allrovi.com,A Hard Day's Night,"June 26, 1964",—,1,"Considering the quality of the original material on With the Beatles, it shouldn't have been a surprise that Lennon & McCartney decided to devote their third album to all-original material. Nevertheless, that decision still impresses, not only because the album is so strong, but because it was written and recorded at a time when the Beatles were constantly touring, giving regular BBC concerts, appearing on television and releasing non-LP singles and EPs, as well as filming their first motion picture. In that context, the achievement of A Hard Day's Night is all the more astounding. Not only was the record the de facto soundtrack for their movie, not only was it filled with nothing but Lennon-McCartney originals, but it found the Beatles truly coming into their own as a band by performing a uniformly excellent set of songs. All of the disparate influences on their first two albums had coalesced into a bright, joyous, original sound filled with ringing guitars and irresistible melodies. They had certainly found their musical voice before, but A Hard Day's Night is where it became mythical. In just a few years, they made more adventurous and accomplished albums, but this is the sound of Beatlemania in all of its giddy glory -- for better and for worse, this is the definitive Beatles album, the one every group throughout the ages has used as a blueprint. Listening to the album, it's easy to see why. Decades after its original release,A Hard Day's Night's punchy blend of propulsive rhythms, jangly guitars, and infectious, singalong melodies is remarkably fresh. There's something intrinsically exciting in the sound of the album itself, something to keep the record vital years after it was recorded. Even more impressive are the songs themselves. Not only are the melodies forceful and memorable, but Lennon and McCartney have found a number of variations to their basic Merseybeat style, from the brash ""Can't Buy Me Love"" and ""Any Time at All,"" through the gentle ""If I Fell,"" to the tough folk-rock of ""I'll Cry Instead."" It's possible to hear both songwriters develop their own distinctive voices on the album, but overall, A Hard Day's Night stands as a testament to their collaborative powers -- never again did they write together so well or so easily, choosing to pursue their own routes. John and Paul must have known how strong the material is -- they threw the pleasant trifle ""I'm Happy Just to Dance with You"" to George and didn't give anything to Ringo to sing. That may have been a little selfish, but it hardly hurts the album, since everything on the record is performed with genuine glee and excitement. It's the pinnacle of their early years."

In the meantime, in addition to doing a tour of the U.S., the group had released their debut movie, A Hard Day's Night -- but the U.S. rights to the soundtrack were owned by United Artists Records (that was, in fact, the basis for United Artists' original interest in producing the movie), which had duly released its soundtrack in late June (and saw it top the charts). Capitol didn't have the soundtrack rights, but it was allowed to use most of the songs from the film; and as it turned out, the Beatles had delivered as fine a body of songs for the movie as they had for any of their albums up to that point -- songs that, as Capitol executives soon discovered, worked just as well in their combination. And so Something New was released about a month after UA's soundtrack, and if it wasn't as strong as the two preceding U.S. albums, in any other context and circumstance it would have been a contender for best rock & roll album of the year. Grouped alongside the band's hard-rocking, first-rate covers of Carl Perkins' ""Matchbox"" and Larry Williams' ""Slow Down,"" and topped out with their German-language rendition of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" (""Komm, Gib Mir Deine Hand""), which probably couldn't fit anywhere else, the Hard Day's Night material sounded fine, and few fans seemed to mind paying twice for the songs that overlapped between the two albums. And no one seemed to notice that this is where the 11-song Beatles' album comes into being, Capitol reasoning out that their material was so strong that they could get away with shaving off one track from the standard dozen, which became routine in the two years of U.S.-created releases that followed."
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/40/Beatlesforsale.jpg,Beatles for Sale,"December 4, 1964",1,—,"It was inevitable that the constant grind of touring, writing, promoting, and recording would grate on the Beatles, but the weariness of Beatles for Sale comes as something of a shock. Only five months before, the group released the joyous A Hard Day's Night. Now, they sound beaten, worn, and, inLennon's case, bitter and self-loathing. His opening trilogy (""No Reply,"" ""I'm a Loser,"" ""Baby's in Black"") is the darkest sequence on any Beatles record, setting the tone for the album. Moments of joy pop up now and again, mainly in the forms of covers and the dynamic ""Eight Days a Week,"" but the very presence of six covers after the triumphant all-original A Hard Day's Night feels like an admission of defeat or at least a regression. (It doesn't help that Lennon's cover of his beloved obscurity ""Mr. Moonlight"" winds up as arguably the worst thing the group ever recorded.) Beneath those surface suspicions, however, there are some important changes on Beatles for Sale, most notably Lennon's discovery of Bob Dylan and folk-rock. The opening three songs, along with ""I Don't Want to Spoil the Party,"" are implicitly confessional and all quite bleak, which is a new development. This spirit winds up overshadowing McCartney's cheery ""I'll Follow the Sun"" or the thundering covers of ""Rock & Roll Music,"" ""Honey Don't,"" and ""Kansas City/Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey!,"" and the weariness creeps up in unexpected places -- ""Every Little Thing,"" ""What You're Doing,"" even George's cover of Carl Perkins' ""Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby"" -- leaving the impression that Beatlemania may have been fun but now the group is exhausted. That exhaustion results in the group's most uneven album, but its best moments find them moving from Merseybeat to the sophisticated pop/rock they developed in mid-career."

Meanwhile, back in the U.S., where sales were easily dwarfing the group's U.K. success by sheer weight of numbers, Capitol Records saw no reason to give 14 new songs to the waiting public, especially as they were sitting on one leftover song from the U.K. A Hard Day's Night album, and had a current single whose two sides, ""I Feel Fine"" and ""She's a Woman,"" they could use to promote whatever they released. The result was Beatles '65, issued a little less than two weeks before the start of that year and ten days before Christmas. This was the first U.S. album on which the commingling of tracks started to wear on the originals. (The Beatles' Second Album had been a miraculous assembly of material from nearly a half-dozen sessions and sources, while Something New was basically theHard Day's Night soundtrack without ""A Hard Day's Night"" or ""Can't Buy Me Love,"" but punched up with a pair of hard-rocking covers.) Beatles '65 was essentially the core of the rather dour Beatles for Sale, punched up with the new single and an offbeat but killer remnant from A Hard Day's Night. While it all sounded OK and duly topped the charts, the cohesion was starting to get lost; between the acoustic-textured Beatles for Sale numbers and the feedback-laden ""I Feel Fine,"" the hard-rocking ""She's a Woman,"" and the somewhat less sharp-edged Carl Perkins covers here, there was less and less method to the compiling for the U.S. This came courtesy of Dave Dexter, Jr., a Capitol executive who'd had to be ordered to start authorizing the release of Beatles material by Capitol in America (as opposed to passing on it and letting other licensees handle it), and seemingly spent most of the next two years trying to prove how right he'd been to neglect them. The odd thing was that, despite the weak and odd recouplings of songs, the album did sell, and song for song it was still better than anything the competition was creating -- as long as the singles were everything they should be, the band was on safe ground. With this and its next release, Capitol was starting to figure out just how valuable each Beatles song was by itself, and how far they could go repackaging them, as long as they retained some measure of common sense. They lost that attribute with the U.S. Help! album, courtesy of Dexter, but in the meantime the label did get out flawed if entertaining compilations such as this."
http://cps-static.rovicorp.com/3/JPG_400/MI0003/685/MI0003685069.jpg?partner=allrovi.com,Beatles VI,"June 14, 1965",—,1,"Six months had elapsed since the release of Beatles '65 in America, and the powers that were at Capitol Records recognized that some new product was needed, especially as the group was about to tour the United States. The result was Beatles VI, using the remaining tracks off of the British-released Beatles for Sale album (going all the way back to the fall of the previous year), among them that album's highlight, a cover of Buddy Holly's ""Words of Love,"" and four new songs, two of them from the second side of the soon-to-be-released U.K. Help! album. The result was as much of a mish-mash as any album of Beatles songs ever assembled by Capitol Records, although -- thanks to the quality of the performances and the songs -- it was still eminently high-quality material, song-for-song, and outclassed virtually all of the competition. And as long as the group's singles held up in quality, albums like this would continue to scale the top of the charts with ease."
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3d/Help.jpg,Help!,"August 6, 1965",1,—,"Considering that Help! functions as the Beatles' fifth album and as the soundtrack to their second film -- while filming, they continued to release non-LP singles on a regular basis -- it's not entirely surprising that it still has some of the weariness of Beatles for Sale. Again, they pad the album with covers, but the Bakersfield bounce of ""Act Naturally"" adds new flavor (along with an ideal showcase for Ringo's amiable vocals) and ""Dizzy Miss Lizzy"" gives John an opportunity to flex his rock & roll muscle. Georgeis writing again and if his two contributions don't touch Lennon and McCartney's originals, they hold their own against much of their British pop peers. Since Lennon wrote a third more songs thanMcCartney, it's easy to forgive a pair of minor numbers (""It's Only Love,"" ""Tell Me What You See""), especially since they're overshadowed by four great songs. His Dylan infatuation holds strong, particularly on the plaintive ""You've Got to Hide Your Love Away"" and the title track, where the brash arrangement disguises Lennon's desperation. Driven by an indelible 12-string guitar, ""Ticket to Ride"" is another masterpiece and ""You're Going to Lose That Girl"" is the kind of song McCartney effortlessly tosses off -- which he does with the jaunty ""The Night Before"" and ""Another Girl,"" two very fine tunes that simply update his melodic signature. He did much better with ""I've Just Seen a Face,"" an irresistible folk-rock gem, and ""Yesterday,"" a simple, beautiful ballad whose arrangement -- an acoustic guitar supported by a string quartet -- and composition suggested much more sophisticated and adventurous musical territory, which the group immediately began exploring with Rubber Soul."
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/74/Rubber_Soul.jpg,Rubber Soul,"December 3, 1965",1,—,"While the Beatles still largely stuck to love songs on Rubber Soul, the lyrics represented a quantum leap in terms of thoughtfulness, maturity, and complex ambiguities. Musically, too, it was a substantial leap forward, with intricate folk-rock arrangements that reflected the increasing influence of Dylan andthe Byrds. The group and George Martin were also beginning to expand the conventional instrumental parameters of the rock group, using a sitar on ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown),"" Greek-like guitar lines on ""Michelle"" and ""Girl,"" fuzz bass on ""Think for Yourself,"" and a piano made to sound like a harpsichord on the instrumental break of ""In My Life."" While John and Paul were beginning to carve separate songwriting identities at this point, the album is full of great tunes, from ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"" and ""Michelle"" to ""Girl,"" ""I'm Looking Through You,"" ""You Won't See Me,"" ""Drive My Car,"" and ""Nowhere Man"" (the last of which was the first Beatle song to move beyond romantic themes entirely). George Harrison was also developing into a fine songwriter with his two contributions, ""Think for Yourself"" and the Byrds-ish ""If I Needed Someone."""

Owing to business and market differences between England and America, the label had reconfigured every one of the group's long-players in America up to that point, and also generated a few LPs out of singles, B-sides, and EP tracks that had no U.K. equivalent on 12"" vinyl -- the Beatles had tolerated it all quietly in the early days, content to go along amid the whirlwind of success they were riding, even in the face of such abominations as the original U.S. Help! album. By 1966, however, they were on a firmer footing, and well past being wide-eyed teenagers from the north of England; they'd also begun to express themselves creatively in media beyond music, and take themselves a bit more seriously, and having a bit more fun as well -- by the spring of 1966, after all, they were neck-deep into the making of the Revolver album. When confronted with what should have been a routine matter, the proposed 11-song U.S.-only Yesterday...and Today, assembling a bunch of single sides and leftover U.K. LP tracks, they delivered the notorious ""butcher cover,"" depicting the quartet in butcher smocks, handling cuts of meat and pieces of dismembered baby dolls -- it was all their comment on how strangely albums like this one seemed to chop up pieces of their history and repertory."
http://www.jpgr.co.uk/pcs7009_a.jpg,Revolver,"August 5, 1966",1,—,"All the rules fell by the wayside with Revolver, as the Beatles began exploring new sonic territory, lyrical subjects, and styles of composition. It wasn't just Lennon and McCartney, either -- Harrisonstaked out his own dark territory with the tightly wound, cynical rocker ""Taxman""; the jaunty yet dissonant ""I Want to Tell You""; and ""Love You To,"" George's first and best foray into Indian music. Such explorations were bold, yet they were eclipsed by Lennon's trippy kaleidoscopes of sound. His most straightforward number was ""Doctor Robert,"" an ode to his dealer, and things just got stranger from there as he buried ""And Your Bird Can Sing"" in a maze of multi-tracked guitars, gave Ringo a charmingly hallucinogenic slice of childhood whimsy in ""Yellow Submarine,"" and then capped it off with a triptych of bad trips: the spiraling ""She Said She Said""; the crawling, druggy ""I'm Only Sleeping""; and ""Tomorrow Never Knows,"" a pure nightmare where John sang portions of the Tibetan Book of the Dead into a suspended microphone over Ringo's thundering, menacing drumbeats and layers of overdubbed, phased guitars and tape loops. McCartney's experiments were formal, as he tried on every pop style from chamber pop to soul, and when placed alongside Lennon's and Harrison's outright experimentations, McCartney's songcraft becomes all the more impressive. The biggest miracle ofRevolver may be that the Beatles covered so much new stylistic ground and executed it perfectly on one record, or it may be that all of it holds together perfectly. Either way, its daring sonic adventures and consistently stunning songcraft set the standard for what pop/rock could achieve. Even after Sgt. Pepper, Revolver stands as the ultimate modern pop album and it's still as emulated as it was upon its original release."
http://www.thatericalper.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Cover-shoot-for-Sgt-Pepper-2.jpg,Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,"June 1, 1967",1,1,"With Revolver, the Beatles made the Great Leap Forward, reaching a previously unheard-of level of sophistication and fearless experimentation. Sgt. Pepper, in many ways, refines that breakthrough, asthe Beatles consciously synthesized such disparate influences as psychedelia, art-song, classical music, rock & roll, and music hall, often in the course of one song. Not once does the diversity seem forced -- the genius of the record is how the vaudevillian ""When I'm 64"" seems like a logical extension of ""Within You Without You"" and how it provides a gateway to the chiming guitars of ""Lovely Rita."" There's no discounting the individual contributions of each member or their producer, George Martin, but the preponderance of whimsy and self-conscious art gives the impression that Paul McCartney is the leader of the Lonely Hearts Club Band. He dominates the album in terms of compositions, setting the tone for the album with his unabashed melodicism and deviously clever arrangements. In comparison, Lennon's contributions seem fewer, and a couple of them are a little slight but his major statements are stunning. ""With a Little Help From My Friends"" is the ideal Ringo tune, a rolling, friendly pop song that hides genuine Lennon anguish, à la ""Help!""; ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds"" remains one of the touchstones of British psychedelia; and he's the mastermind behind the bulk of ""A Day in the Life,"" a haunting number that skillfully blends Lennon's verse and chorus with McCartney's bridge. It's possible to argue that there are better Beatles albums, yet no album is as historically important as this. After Sgt. Pepper, there were no rules to follow -- rock and pop bands could try anything, for better or worse. Ironically, few tried to achieve the sweeping, all-encompassing embrace of music as the Beatlesdid here."
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/85/TheBeatlesMagicalMysteryTouralbumcover.jpg,Magical Mystery Tour,"November 27, 1967",31[D],1,"The U.S. version of the soundtrack for the Beatles' ill-fated British television special embellished the six songs that were found on the British Magical Mystery Tour double EP with five other cuts from their 1967 singles. (The CD version of the record has now been standardized worldwide as the 11 tracks found on the American version.) The psychedelic sound is very much in the vein of Sgt. Pepper's, and even spacier in parts (especially the sound collages of ""I Am the Walrus""). Unlike Sgt. Pepper's, there's no vague overall conceptual/thematic unity to the material, which has made Magical Mystery Toursuffer slightly in comparison. Still, the music is mostly great, and ""Penny Lane,"" ""Strawberry Fields Forever,"" ""All You Need Is Love,"" and ""Hello Goodbye"" were all huge, glorious, and innovative singles. The ballad ""The Fool on the Hill,"" though only a part of the Magical Mystery Tour soundtrack, is also one of the most popular Beatles tunes from the era."
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/TheBeatles68LP.jpg,The Beatles,"November 22, 1968",1,1,"Each song on the sprawling double album The Beatles is an entity to itself, as the band touches on anything and everything it can. This makes for a frustratingly scattershot record or a singularly gripping musical experience, depending on your view, but what makes the so-called White Album interesting is its mess. Never before had a rock record been so self-reflective, or so ironic; the Beach Boys send-up ""Back in the U.S.S.R."" and the British blooze parody ""Yer Blues"" are delivered straight-faced, so it's never clear if these are affectionate tributes or wicked satires. Lennon turns in two of his best ballads with ""Dear Prudence"" and ""Julia""; scours the Abbey Road vaults for the musique concrète collage ""Revolution 9""; pours on the schmaltz for Ringo's closing number, ""Good Night""; celebrates theBeatles cult with ""Glass Onion""; and, with ""Cry Baby Cry,"" rivals Syd Barrett. McCartney doesn't reach quite as far, yet his songs are stunning -- the music hall romp ""Honey Pie,"" the mock country of ""Rocky Raccoon,"" the ska-inflected ""Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da,"" and the proto-metal roar of ""Helter Skelter."" Clearly, the Beatles' two main songwriting forces were no longer on the same page, but neither wereGeorge and Ringo. Harrison still had just two songs per LP, but it's clear from ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps,"" the canned soul of ""Savoy Truffle,"" the haunting ""Long, Long, Long,"" and even the silly ""Piggies"" that he had developed into a songwriter who deserved wider exposure. And Ringo turns in a delight with his first original, the lumbering country-carnival stomp ""Don't Pass Me By."" None of it sounds like it was meant to share album space together, but somehow The Beatles creates its own style and sound through its mess."
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ac/TheBeatles-YellowSubmarinealbumcover.jpg,Yellow Submarine,"January 13, 1969",3,2,"The only Beatles album that could really be classified as inessential, mostly because it wasn't really a proper album at all, but a soundtrack that only utilized four new Beatles songs. (The rest of the album was filled out with ""Yellow Submarine,"" ""All You Need Is Love,"" and a George Martin score.) What's more, two of the four new tracks were little more than pleasant throwaways that had been recorded during 1967 and early 1968. These aren't all that bad; ""All Together Now"" is a cute, kiddieishMcCartney singalong, while ""Hey Bulldog"" has some mild Lennon nastiness and a great beat and central piano riff, with some fine playing all around -- each is memorable in its way, and the inclusion of the Lennon song here was all the more important, as the sequence from the movie itself in which it was used was deleted from the original U.S. release of the movie (which had no success whatever in the U.K. and quickly disappeared, thus making the U.S. version the established cut of the film for decades, until the late-'90s restoration and DVD re-release of the movie). George Harrison's two contributions were the more striking of the new entries -- ""Only a Northern Song,"" a leftover from the Sgt. Pepper'ssessions, generated from a period in which the guitarist became increasingly fascinated with keyboards, especially the organ and the Mellotron (and, later, the synthesizer), and is an odd piece of psychedelic ersatz, mixing trippiness and some personal comments; its lyrics (and title) on the one hand express the guitarist/singer/composer's displeasure at being tied in his publishing to Northern Songs, a company in which John Lennon and Paul McCartney were the majority shareholders; and, on the other, they present Harrison's vision of how music and recording sounded, from the inside out and the outside in, during the psychedelic era -- the song thus provided a rare glimpse inside the doors of perception of being a Beatle (or, at least, one aspect of being this particular Beatle) circa 1967. And then there was the jewel of the new songs, ""It's All Too Much""; coming from the second half of 1967, the song -- resplendent in swirling Mellotron, larger-than-life percussion, and tidal waves of feedback guitar -- was a virtuoso excursion into otherwise hazy psychedelia, that was actually superior in some respects to ""Blue Jay Way,"" Harrison's songwriting contribution of The Magical Mystery Tour; the song also later rated a dazzling cover by Steve Hillage in the middle of the following decade. The very fact thatGeorge Harrison was afforded two song slots and a relatively uncompetitive canvas for his music shows how little the project meant to Lennon and McCartney -- as did the cutting of the ""Hey Bulldog"" sequence from the movie, apparently with no resistance from Lennon, who had other, more important artistic fish to fry in 1968. What is here, however, is a good enough reason for owning the record, though nothing rates it as anything near a high-priority purchase."

Pepper, but featuring stronger compositions and more rock-oriented ensemble work. The group was still pushing forward in all facets of its art, whether devising some of the greatest harmonies to be heard on any rock record (especially on ""Because""), constructing a medley of songs/vignettes that covered much of side two, adding subtle touches of Moog synthesizer, or crafting furious guitar-heavy rock (""The End,"" ""I Want You (She's So Heavy),"" ""Come Together""). George Harrison also blossomed into a major songwriter, contributing the buoyant ""Here Comes the Sun"" and the supremely melodic ballad ""Something,"" the latter of which became the first Harrison-penned Beatles hit. Whether Abbey Road isthe Beatles' best work is debatable, but it's certainly the most immaculately produced (with the possible exception of Sgt. Pepper) and most tightly constructed."
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/25/LetItBe.jpg,Let It Be,"May 8, 1970",1,1,"The only Beatles album to occasion negative, even hostile reviews, there are few other rock records as controversial as Let It Be. First off, several facts need to be explained: although released in May 1970, this was not their final album, but largely recorded in early 1969, way before Abbey Road. Phil Spectorwas enlisted in early 1970 to do some post-production work, but did not work with the band as a unit, as George Martin and Glyn Johns had on the sessions themselves; Spector's work was limited to mixing and some overdubs. And, although his use of strings has generated much criticism, by and large he left the original performances to stand as is: only ""The Long and Winding Road"" and (to a lesser degree) ""Across the Universe"" and ""I Me Mine"" get the wall-of-sound layers of strings and female choruses. Although most of the album, then, has a live-in-the-studio feel, the main problem was that the material wasn't uniformly strong, and that the Beatles themselves were in fairly lousy moods due to inter-group tension. All that said, the album is on the whole underrated, even discounting the fact that a sub-standard Beatles record is better than almost any other group's best work. McCartney in particular offers several gems: the gospelish ""Let It Be,"" which has some of his best lyrics; ""Get Back,"" one of his hardest rockers; and the melodic ""The Long and Winding Road,"" ruined by Spector's heavy-handed overdubs (the superior string-less, choir-less version was finally released on Anthology Vol. 3). The folky ""Two of Us,"" with John and Paul harmonizing together, was also a highlight. Most of the rest of the material, by contrast, was going through the motions to some degree, although there are some good moments of straight hard rock in ""I've Got a Feeling"" and ""Dig a Pony."" As flawed and bumpy as it is, it's an album well worth having, as when the Beatles were in top form here, they were as good as ever."
